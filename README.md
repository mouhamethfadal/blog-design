# Blog Architecture Design

This repository contains the architectural design and interaction flows for my personal blog platform. The design documentation provides a comprehensive view of the system's architecture, components, and their interactions.

## Contents

- System Architecture Diagram
- Component Interactions
- Sequence Diagrams for Key Flows
- Security Considerations

## Design Overview

The architecture is designed with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalability in mind
- Security best practices
- Efficient data management

## Repository Structure

Each diagram is stored in individual files:
- Architecture diagrams (`.mmd`)
- Interaction flows (`.mmd`)

## Tools Used

All diagrams are created using Mermaid, ensuring:
- Version control friendly format
- Easy updates and modifications
- Clear visualization of system components
- Maintainable documentation
